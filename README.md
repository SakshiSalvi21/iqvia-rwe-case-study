## Overview

This repository contains a portfolio case study documenting my work designing and delivering global Real-World Evidence (RWE) study solutions at **IQVIA**.

The work focuses on **systems and workflow design**, rather than traditional visual UI design. The primary design surface was **Sculptor**, a configuration-based interface used to design, validate, localize, and deploy clinical study solutions at scale.

## My Role

**Business Systems Analyst / Solution Designer**

I led end-to-end solution design across ~5 global RWE studies, owning the workflow from discovery through release.

**Responsibilities included:**
- Translating stakeholder and clinical requirements into structured, scalable system designs
- Designing configuration logic, validation rules, and reusable templates in Sculptor
- Iterating designs in an agile, feedback-driven environment
- Managing localization and translation across 25+ countries
- Conducting cross-device testing and UAT
- Coordinating releases with engineering and QA teams
- Ensuring audit readiness and data integrity across deployments

## What This Case Study Demonstrates

- **Systems thinking:** Designing for clarity, scalability, and error prevention
- **Complex workflow design:** Managing ambiguity across global, regulated environments
- **Language as part of the product:** Localization, translation validation, and content structure
- **Ownership:** From requirements gathering to deployment and post-release validation
- **Collaboration:** Close partnership with clinical, operational, QA, and engineering teams
